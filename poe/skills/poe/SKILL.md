# Path of Exile CLI Toolkit

You have access to the `poe` CLI — a toolkit for PoE character optimization. All commands output JSON by default. Add `--human` for readable output. Use Bash to run commands.

## Domains

| Domain | Commands | When to use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Build** | `poe build ...` | Reading, analyzing, or modifying Path of Building XML files |
| **Sim** | `poe sim ...` | Querying mod pools, fossils, essences, bench crafts, simulating crafting costs |
| **Ninja** | `poe ninja ...` | Live economy prices, build search, meta analysis, atlas strategies from poe.ninja |

## Quick Start

| User wants... | Domain | Start with... |
|---|---|---|
| Build review / optimization | Build | `poe build analyze` → drill into weak areas |
| Crafting help for an item | Sim | `poe sim mods` / `poe sim analyze` |
| Live item prices / economy | Ninja | `poe ninja price check` / `poe ninja price list` |
| Meta overview / popular builds | Ninja | `poe ninja meta summary` |
| Compare build to meta | Ninja | `poe ninja builds compare` |
| Compare two local builds | Build | `poe build compare` |
| "What mods can roll on X?" | Sim | `poe sim mods "<base>"` |
| "Best way to craft X?" | Sim | `poe sim suggest` / `poe sim compare` |
| Quick build snapshot | Build | `poe build summary` |
| General PoE question | — | Your PoE knowledge — read `mechanics.md` for reference |

## Deep Dives

Read these files (in this skill's directory) for detailed command reference and guidance:

- **`build.md`** — All build commands, PoB structure, multi-spec/set handling, safety layer, write commands
- **`craft.md`** — Crafting commands, simulation, advice approach, data management, limitations
- **`ninja.md`** — Live economy, build search, meta analysis, atlas strategies, compound workflows
- **`mechanics.md`** — PoE damage, defenses, passive tree, gem links, stat interpretation

Read the relevant file based on what the user is asking about. Don't read all of them upfront.
